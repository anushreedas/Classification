# Classification
 IMplements two classifiers: Least-square linear classifier and k-nn classifier
 
 Replicates the plots shown in "The Elements of Statistical Learning" 
 
 The program defines a least-squares linear classifier as given by Hastie. Then create a plot containing 1) the training samples, 2) the decision boundary separating class 0 and 1, and finally 3) the classification regions, and saves the result as an image file.
 
 It also createa (and save as images) two additional plots, for the nearest neighbor classifiers:
 i.   A 1-nn (nearest neighbor) classifier
 ii.  A 15-nn (15-nearest neighbor) classifier

On the terminal, the program creates text output showing the classification rate (%correct) and confusion matrix for each classifier.
